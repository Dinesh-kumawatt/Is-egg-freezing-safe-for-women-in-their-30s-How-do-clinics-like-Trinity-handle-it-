Yes, egg freezing is safe and smart for many women in their late 20s or early 30sâ€”especially if they want to delay pregnancy due to career, health issues, or not finding the right partner yet. The younger you are when you freeze your eggs, the better the quality.

Clinics like Trinity IVF use vitrification (a fast-freezing method) that helps eggs survive the thawing process with high success. Women can choose to freeze their eggs and use them later with IVF when they are ready for parenthood.

Egg retrieval is done under light sedation, and itâ€™s usually safe with minor cramps afterward. You may need hormone injections for 10â€“12 days before that. Once frozen, the eggs can be stored for 5â€“10 years.

Freezing is a big decision, but many women regret not doing it when they had the chance. Trinityâ€™s doctors guide you properly with tests like AMH and AFC before starting, so you know if your egg count and quality are good for freezing.
